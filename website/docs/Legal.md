# Legal Statement

In the creation and deployment of this tool, we have prioritised compliance with key data privacy regulations, contractual obligations, and intellectual property laws to ensure ethical and legal use.

## **1. Caldicott 7 Rules**

Adherence to the Caldicott 7 Rules has been integral to our approach. These principles serve as a framework for handling sensitive information responsibly. Aside from the hazard report, which we specifically advise people not to write sensitive data in, no collection of data is performed. The ChatGPT API does not collect any data outside of the report submitted.

## **2. GDPR Compliance**

In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we have implemented robust data protection measures to safeguard the personal data of individuals involved in our project. This includes obtaining informed consent, ensuring data accuracy and integrity, and providing individuals with control over their personal information. Our commitment to GDPR compliance underscores our dedication to respecting individual privacy rights and maintaining transparency in data processing activities.

## **3. Contracts - Terms and Conditions**

Our collaboration with the IFRC is governed by comprehensive contracts outlining the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of all parties involved. Through clear and enforceable terms and conditions, we establish the legal framework for data sharing, intellectual property ownership, and liability allocation. By meticulously drafting these agreements, we mitigate potential legal risks and foster a collaborative environment conducive to innovation and knowledge exchange. 

## **4. Licenses and Intellectual Property**

Intellectual property rights are a cornerstone of our collaboration, ensuring that innovations resulting from our work are protected and appropriately licensed. Through the diligent application of intellectual property laws and licensing agreements, we agree to follow the contract signed through the COMP0016 module. This includes handing over intellectual rights to the appropriate parties at the end of the academic term.

## **5. Other Legal Considerations and Legislation**

Beyond the aforementioned frameworks, we remain vigilant in complying with other relevant legal considerations and legislation. This includes but is not limited to industry-specific regulations, such as healthcare data privacy laws, and international agreements governing cross-border data transfers. By staying abreast of evolving legal landscapes and proactively adapting our practices, we ensure continued compliance and uphold the trust placed in our collaboration.

## 6. Conclusion

In conclusion, our collaboration with the IFRC reflects a steadfast commitment to legal and ethical principles governing data privacy, contractual agreements, and intellectual property rights. Through adherence to established frameworks and proactive risk management, we strive to advance our shared objectives while maintaining the highest standards of integrity and accountability.
